ECE 382 Lab 1


#Objective
The goal of this lab was to create a calculator that would add and subtract.  It would know to add or subtract based on the value of the values put into the calculator.

#Design
The preliminary stages of the code are found in the attached Flowchart.

#Code
After writing the code, I ran into a memory error.  As I understood it, the code would not fit into a certain area of memory.  I was not able to fix this problem so the code would not correctly run.

#Documentation

I received no help on this assignment.
